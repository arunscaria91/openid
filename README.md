OpenID-ATutor
=============

OpenID module for ATutor[PHP]
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

  The module provides OpenID feature to the ATutor.  Which enables users to register and  log 
  in to the ATutor without much pain. They can manage their content without keeping a separate 
  username password combo. This module can work with OAuth based Google app module to import 
  Google services to the ATutor.

  The OpenID module for ATutor is an anytime pluggable module that can help the Atutor users 
  to login from their Google account rather than registering a new account. The current plan 
  is to finish the Google OpenID support first without OAuth support. After completion of this 
  functionalities as a module, other major OpenID providers like Facebook, twitter and yahoo 
  etc are added to the module. Also the OAuth support is added to the module if it is believed
  to result a fruitful outcome, after a few discussions.
